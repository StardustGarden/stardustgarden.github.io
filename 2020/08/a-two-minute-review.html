            <p>This is a collection of (in my opinion) notable games among a total of 125 submission entries for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/two-minute-horror-jam">Two-Minute Horror Jam</a>, which lasted a month from May to June 14 of 2020.</p>

<p>I haven’t played all of them, so I might be missing a lot more. However, I still managed to gather a bunch of games that I found interesting/stand out. I’m sure there are still wonderful games out there to be found.</p>

<h3 id="there-are-ghosts-in-these-stalls---by-elisha"><strong><a href="https://wrlck.itch.io/there-are-ghosts-in-these-stalls">There Are Ghosts In These Stalls</a></strong> - by <em>Elisha</em></h3>
<p>I found the premise similar to that of The Slender Man, in which you collect four cryptic symbols, and paranormal activities are slowly uncovered as you progress. Except you can’t move around this time, and things get sp00ky real quick, mostly because of the sound design, which kept me on edge most of the time.</p>

<h3 id="what-awaits-us-below---by-davidrodmad"><strong><a href="https://davidrodmad.itch.io/what-awaits-us-below">What Awaits Us Below</a></strong> - by <em>davidrodmad</em></h3>
<p>A very unique one. Collecting clues to solve a puzzle and getting yourself out, whilst falling down into the remains of what appears to be a failed experiment. And it seems like what lies beneath have the psychic powers which draws people into them, which is exactly what happened to your colleagues, who all fell into their unknown faith (but presumably dead). The game also has some replayable values as you’ll need to restart a few times in order to fully grasp all the lore, the notes, the items… until finally be able to solve the puzzle. A worthy investment of your time.</p>

<h3 id="spookware---by-papercookies--viktorrkraus"><strong><a href="https://papercookies.itch.io/spookware">SPOOKWARE</a></strong> - by <em>papercookies</em> &amp; <em>ViktorRKraus</em></h3>
<p>Pure gameplay-wise, SPOOKWARE is the clear winner out of this list. A collection of 10 short games in a classic high-score, 3-lives-only format. Quick &amp; precise timing is important. A solid, fun compilation you’ve got to get your hands on!</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/a-two-minute-review/spookware.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="i-am-brewing-you-alive-but-you-can-leave-at-any-time-if-you-really-want-to---by-autumn-rain"><strong><a href="https://slitherpunk.itch.io/brew">I Am Brewing You Alive But You Can Leave At Any Time If You Really Want To</a></strong> - by <em>Autumn Rain</em></h3>
<p>It appears that you were found by a witch under unknown circumstances, who then proceeds to brew you into “an evil potion”, all while you’re still alive, because why not. Apparently, she’s pretty lonely, and doesn’t get many “visitors”, as seen in the game. You have the option of leaving, or stay and get brewed while falling for this cute witch. A memorable five-minute experience, and certainly one of my favorites on this list.</p>

<h3 id="come-on-come-on-come-on---by-justen-brown"><strong><a href="https://jayb33.itch.io/come-on">COME ON! COME ON! COME ON!</a></strong> - by <em>Justen Brown</em></h3>
<p>Bringing an unexpected twist to the classic countdown clock mechanism commonly found in horror games, <strong>COME ON! COME ON! COME ON!</strong> is most effective going in blind. It’s really, really good. There are also several endings available, although I’ve only managed to get three.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/a-two-minute-review/comeon.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="subterror---by-escher-vision"><strong><a href="https://escher-vision.itch.io/subterror">SUBTERROR</a></strong> - by <em>Escher Vision</em></h3>

<p>You wake up in a sinking ship, all alone, and someone is trying to initiate a distress call. Suddenly, blood begins to flow out everywhere, slowly engulfing the ship, while there’s a mysterious, green-ish ghostly figure floating in front of a sign which vaguely reads “guilty”. The setup is certainly very interesting, and there’s potential for more plot points to be uncovered. Sadly, for a mere length of a little over 2 minutes, we might never knew what really happened.</p>

<h3 id="blackout---by-fer"><strong><a href="https://fergonzalez.itch.io/blackout">blackout</a></strong> - by <em>Fer</em></h3>
<p>Your car crashed, and your companion died. Things quickly got out of hand as you discovered another survivor, claiming there’s something sinister and that he insists the player to leave him alone. A short one with some interesting backstory behind.</p>

<h2 id="runner-ups">Runner-Ups</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://bee3001.itch.io/hart-of-gold">Hart Of Gold</a>: A simple 2-minute platformer, but the animation work went into it is incredible!</li>
  <li><a href="https://brynh123.itch.io/falling-between">Falling Between</a>: An extremely short experience which would leave you wondering what the f**k happened, whilst craving for more at the same time. I haven’t indulged myself into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junji_Ito">Junji Ito</a>’s material yet, so I might be missing something. A cool journey nonetheless.</li>
  <li><a href="https://ribyrnes.itch.io/candypink">candypink</a>: A cute game revolving around marshmallow cooking. You should expect just the usual stuff… or should you?</li>
  <li><a href="https://theabstractcnceptofcheese.itch.io/plastic-cave-adventure-2">Plastic Cave Adventure 2</a>: A narrative-focused short game, not exactly horror, but still pretty odd. It has that bit of breaking the fourth wall feeling to it, too.</li>
  <li><a href="https://responsiblefile.itch.io/sapphire">Heavenly Blue Collection Sapphire</a>: This one I couldn’t have a solid grasp on what’s happening, but it’s worth a look just for the (overly) cryptic/weird-y vibes. And the presentation is cool.</li>
  <li><a href="https://fragmenta.itch.io/beast">beast</a>: Another surreal story revolving you, a red hoodie, and a beast who seek to destroy a village.</li>
  <li><a href="https://bullettrain101.itch.io/bargin-market">Bargin Market</a>: There’s not much to say about this one - except it has a message to deliver and I think that alone is more than enough, though the presentation itself is plainly bad and clearly needs some more polishing work.</li>
